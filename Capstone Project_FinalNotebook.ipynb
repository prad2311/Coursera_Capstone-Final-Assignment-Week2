    "# 1.\tIntroduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the IBM Data Science professional program project, I have reached out to one of my close acquaintance who is the restaurant owner of INKA Australia https://www.inkarestaurant.com.au/ and will be doing analysis on the best western suburbs in Melbourne, Australia chosen by the management to expand their business. This is a real time example for which I will be performing analysis and advising the management as to which would be the best suburb from the 3 councils (Hobsons Bay, Brimbank,Wyndham)\n",
    "### 1.1.\tBackground\n",
    "    \n",
    "INKA Australia is one of the Indian restaurants which is located in the inner suburbs (Hawthorn) of Melbourne, Australia. During one of the conversations, the restaurant management have expressed their plans of expansion of their business to Western Suburbs in Melbourne.  \n",
    "###  1.2.\tBusiness Problem\n",
    "    \n",
    "Since expanding their restaurant business to other suburbs would be a cost and risk-based plan for the management, they have selected 3 councils i.e, Hobsons Bay, Brimbank and Wyndham but again there is challenge for them to select out of 60 suburbs as to which would be the best suburb for the setup. In this project, I will go through step by step process to make a decision based on the data that might contribute to determine the feasible location to open the Indian restaurant.\n",
    "We will analyse the localities in the western suburbs in Melbourne to identify the most profitable suburb since the success of the restaurant depends on the nearby venues and categories. \n",
    "In this project, I will go through all the process and will provide a conclusion whether the analysis can be leveraged by the business stakeholders to make their decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.\tData Requirements and Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Few Data components are deemed as key factors in selecting the restaurant location We need to analyse the councils’ data, geo-location about the 3 chosen councils as the management has already made up their mind about the councils. Throughout the assignment, I will be using missing value imputation, Foursquare API, Folium map and k-mean clustering. \n",
    "\n",
    " ### 2.1.\tData Sources\n",
    " -I will be downloading the information from the site https://www.matthewproctor.com/full_australian_postcodes_vic for Melbourne, Victoria Location data which will make my analysis handy, as it has all the relevant information for the project. Geo-locational information (latitude and longitude ) about that specific locality and the suburbs. I will be using the Australian_postcodes.xls version downloaded from the website. \n",
    "-Foursquare API locational information to be used. (basic and advanced information about that venue)\n",
    "-Data about different venues in different localities based on the suburb under the local councils\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 How the data will be used to solve the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The data are going to be used as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Use Foursquare and geopy information to map venues for all 3 local councils  and clustered in teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Use foursquare and geopy information to map the placement of which suburb would be the best suitable location based on the K Clusters using 5, individually and on high of the above-clustered map.\n",
    "\n",
    "-create a map that depicts, the suburb which has the hight K means to select the best suitable location to setup the restaurant \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3.\tMethodology\n",
    "\n",
    "This section represents the main component of the report where the data is gathered, prepared for analysis. The tools described are used here and the Notebook cells indicates the execution of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The analysis and the stragegy:\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will normalise the data based on the list of councils extracted from the https://www.matthewproctor.com/full_australian_postcodes_vic . Then we will select the 3 councils selected by the restaurant management. We will do the missing value imputation if they have any missing values/NAN. Then we will use the Four square APIS to get the data about the venues in the 3 councils - localitys'. we will create a map using cluster (K=5) and find which cluster has the highest value under the suburb. \n",
